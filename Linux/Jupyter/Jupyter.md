Project Jupyter exists to develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages.

### Try Jupyter

:link: [Try Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/try) - Oneline

You can try Jupyter out right now, without installing anything. Select an example below and you will get a temporary Jupyter server just for you, running on mybinder.org. If you like it, you can install Jupyter yourself.

### JupyterHubs

:link: [JupyterHub](http://jupyter.org/hub)

A multi-user version of the notebook designed for companies, classrooms and research labs.

JupyterHub brings the power of notebooks to groups of users. It gives users access to computational environments and resources without burdening the users with installation and maintenance tasks. Users - including students, researchers, and data scientists - can get their work done in their own workspaces on shared resources which can be managed efficiently by system administrators.

JupyterHub runs in the cloud or on your own hardware, and makes it possible to serve a pre-configured data science environment to any user in the world. It is customizable and scalable, and is suitable for small and large teams, academic courses, and large-scale infrastructure.

### Nbviewer

:link: [Jupyter Notebook Viewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)

A simple way to share Jupyter Notebooks.This website does not host notebooks, it only renders notebooks available on other websites.

[nbviewer](https://github.com/jupyter/nbviewer) is a web application that lets you enter the URL of a Jupyter Notebook file, renders that notebook as a static HTML web page, and gives you a stable link to that page which you can share with others. nbviewer also supports browsing collections of notebooks (e.g., in a GitHub repository) and rendering notebooks in other formats (e.g., slides, scripts).

### binder

:link: [binder](https://mybinder.org/)

Turn a Git repo into a collection of interactive notebooks.

Have a repository full of Jupyter notebooks? With Binder, open those notebooks in an executable environment, making your code immediately reproducible by anyone, anywhere.
