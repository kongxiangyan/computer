gitignore - Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.

## DESCRIPTION

A `gitignore` file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. Files already tracked by Git are not affected; see the NOTES below for details.

Each line in a `gitignore` file specifies a pattern. When deciding whether to ignore a path, Git normally checks `gitignore` patterns from multiple sources, with the following order of precedence, from highest to lowest (within one level of precedence, the last matching pattern decides the outcome):

- Patterns read from the command line for those commands that support them.
- Patterns read from a `.gitignore` file in the same directory as the path, or in any parent directory, with patterns in the higher level files (up to the toplevel of the work tree) being overridden by those in lower level files down to the directory containing the file. These patterns match relative to the location of the `.gitignore` file. A project normally includes such `.gitignore` files in its repository, containing patterns for files generated as part of the project build.
- Patterns read from `$GIT_DIR/info/exclude`.
- Patterns read from the file specified by the configuration variable `core.excludesFile`.

Which file to place a pattern in depends on how the pattern is meant to be used.

- Patterns which should be version-controlled and distributed to other repositories via clone (i.e., files that all developers will want to ignore) should go into a `.gitignore` file.
- Patterns which are specific to a particular repository but which do not need to be shared with other related repositories (e.g., auxiliary files that live inside the repository but are specific to one user’s workflow) should go into the `$GIT_DIR/info/exclude` file.
- Patterns which a user wants Git to ignore in all situations (e.g., backup or temporary files generated by the user’s editor of choice) generally go into a file specified by `core.excludesFile` in the user’s `~/.gitconfig`. Its default value is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is either not set or empty, $HOME/.config/git/ignore is used instead.

The underlying Git plumbing tools, such as *git ls-files* and *git read-tree*, read `gitignore` patterns specified by command-line options, or from files specified by command-line options. Higher-level Git tools, such as *git status* and *git add*, use patterns from the sources specified above.

## Pattern Format

- A blank line matches no files, so it can serve as a separator for readability.
- A line starting with # serves as a comment. Put a backslash ("`\`") in front of the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash.
- Trailing spaces are ignored unless they are quoted with backslash ("`\`").
- An optional prefix "`!`" which negates the pattern; any matching file excluded by a previous pattern will become included again. It is not possible to re-include a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded. Git doesn’t list excluded directories for performance reasons, so any patterns on contained files have no effect, no matter where they are defined. Put a backslash ("`\`") in front of the first "`!`" for patterns that begin with a literal "`!`", for example, "`\!important!.txt`".
- If the pattern ends with a slash, it is removed for the purpose of the following description, but it would only find a match with a directory. In other words, `foo/` will match a directory `foo` and paths underneath it, but will not match a regular file or a symbolic link `foo` (this is consistent with the way how pathspec works in general in Git).
- If the pattern does not contain a slash */*, Git treats it as a shell glob pattern and checks for a match against the pathname relative to the location of the `.gitignore` file (relative to the toplevel of the work tree if not from a `.gitignore` file).
- Otherwise, Git treats the pattern as a shell glob: "`*`" matches anything except "`/`", "`?`" matches any one character except "`/`" and "`[]`" matches one character in a selected range. See fnmatch(3) and the FNM_PATHNAME flag for a more detailed description.
- A leading slash matches the beginning of the pathname. For example, "/*.c" matches "cat-file.c" but not "mozilla-sha1/sha1.c".

Two consecutive asterisks ("`**`") in patterns matched against full pathname may have special meaning:

- A leading "`**`" followed by a slash means match in all directories. For example, "`**/foo`" matches file or directory "`foo`" anywhere, the same as pattern "`foo`". "`**/foo/bar`" matches file or directory "`bar`" anywhere that is directly under directory "`foo`".
- A trailing "`/**`" matches everything inside. For example, "`abc/**`" matches all files inside directory "`abc`", relative to the location of the `.gitignore` file, with infinite depth.
- A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches zero or more directories. For example, "`a/**/b`" matches "`a/b`", "`a/x/b`", "`a/x/y/b`" and so on.
- Other consecutive asterisks are considered invalid.

## IDE 自动构建

### Visual Studio Code

#### gitignore

A extension for Visual Studio Code that assists you in working with `.gitignore` files.

##### Features

- Language support for `.gitignore` files
- Add local `.gitignore` by pulling file from the the [github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore) repository.

##### Usage

Start command palette (with `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `F1`) and start typing `Add gitignore`

##### Settings

```JavaScript
{
    // Number of seconds the list of `.gitignore` files retrieved from github will be cached
    "gitignore.cacheExpirationInterval": 3600
}
```

## Use Manual

### Comand

```bash
# 强制添加.gitignore中包含的文件
# $ git add App.class
# The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
# App.class
# Use -f if you really want to add them.
git add -f App.class

# 检查gitignore文件语法
# https://git-scm.com/docs/git-check-ignore
git check-ignore
```

### 移除已提交的文件的版本控制

```bash
# 实质就是删除缓冲区里的文件，再提交给服务器端
git rm -r -n --cached ${some-directory} # -n：加上这个参数，执行命令时，是不会删除任何文件，而是展示此命令要删除的文件列表预览。
git rm -r --cached ${some-directory} # 最终执行命令
git commit -m 'Remove the now ignored directory "${some-directory}"' # 提交
git push origin master # 提交到远程服务器

此时 git status 看到 ${some-directory} 目录状态变为 untracked 可以修改 .gitignore  文件，添加 ${some-directory} 并提交 .gitignore 文件到远程服务器，这样就可以不对 ${some-directory} 目录进行版本管理了。以后需要的时候,只需要注释 .gitignore 里 ${some-directory} 内容,重新执行 git add ${some-directory}，即可重新纳入版本管理。

# git rm命令参数
-n --dry-run 
# Don’t actually remove any file(s). Instead, just show if they exist in the index and would otherwise be removed by the command.
-r 
# Allow recursive removal when a leading directory name is given. 
--cached 
# Use this option to unstage and remove paths only from the index. Working tree files, whether modified or not, will be left alone.
```
